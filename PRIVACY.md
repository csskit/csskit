# Privacy Policy

This software does not access the network or any local services to send telemetry information or any personal data to any third parties.

We _reserve_ the right to one day gather telemetry during normal operation, such as the timing of specific operations. This, however:

 - _must_ only be for the purposes of improving the applications performance or robustness.
 - _must_ only be stored locally by default.
 - _may_ only be sent over the network given explicit, detailed, user consent each and every time.
 - _must never_ contain any personally identifiable information (PII) such as (including but not limited to) IP addresses, file names or directories, user names.
 - _must never_ be sent to a third party service. Third party services (such as hosting) must only receive encrypted payloads, and the unencrypted data must only be viewable on servers within the projects control.
 - _must never_ include data used to correlate multiple events, such as a device-id, cookie, or other data which can link two discrete executions of the software.

To the best of the capabilities of the project team this software will never advertise, promote or otherwise upsell any other products or services, nor solicit for funding or other payment during normal use. Any attempts to solicit payment using this software can be considered fraudulent and should be reported immediately using the issue tracker (https://github.com/keithamus/hdx/issues/new).
