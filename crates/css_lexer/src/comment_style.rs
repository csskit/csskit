/// "Block" - comments, but adding [Feature::SeparateWhitespace][crate::Feature::SingleLineComments] will allow the
/// [Lexer][crate::Lexer] to produce single line comments too.
///
/// A basic [Block][CommentStyle::Block] comment style uses the `/*` leading characters, but sub-styles of the block
/// style are also computed, for example [BlockStar][CommentStyle::BlockStar] represents a comment using the "double
/// star" syntax to open the comment, i.e. `/**`. Determing if these comments are using these alternate style can help a
/// parser (or writer) determine if it should retain these comments or otherwise treat them differently to regular block
/// comments.
