/// This trait allows AST nodes to construct themselves from a mutable [Parser] instance.
///
/// Nodes that implement this trait are entitled to consume any number of [Cursors][css_lexer::Cursor] from [Parser] in
/// order to construct themselves. They may also consume some amount of tokens and still return an [Err] - there is no
/// need to try and reset the [Parser] state on failure ([Parser::try_parse()] exists for this reason).
///
/// When wanting to parse child nodes, implementations should _not_ call [Parse::parse()] directly. Instead - call
/// [`Parser::parse<T>()`]. Other convenience methods such as [`Parser::parse_if_peek<T>()`] and [`Parser::try_parse<T>()`]
/// exist.
///
/// Any node implementing [Parse::parse()] gets [Parse::try_parse()] for free. It's unlikely that nodes can come up with
/// a more efficient algorithm than the provided one, so it is not worth re-implementing [Parse::try_parse()].
///
/// If a Node can construct itself from a single [Cursor][css_lexer::Cursor] it should instead implement
/// [Peek][crate::Peek] and [Build][crate::Build], which will provide [Parse] for free.
