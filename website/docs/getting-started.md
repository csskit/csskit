# Getting Started

Let's get you set up with hdx then! First, you'll need to install it.

## Installation

The `hdx` package provides everything you need to get started. Install that to
your project. You probably want to use `npm` to install it, like this:

```shell
npm i hdx
```

With it installed run the `hdx` command and give it a file, and it'll emit the
contents to `stdout`:

```shell
npx hdx ./path/to/my.css
```
